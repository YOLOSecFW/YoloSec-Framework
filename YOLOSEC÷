YOLOSEC÷

All fights over skills vs certs will be quelled with the release of YOLOSEC÷ 

Only when doing #infosec by the seat of your pants do the true skills come out. 

Requirements for certification:

Just need to pass the test with 20% and 20 years of #yolosec experience. But we'll let it slide if you know a guy. 
Doesn't even have to be a guy. Could be a goat or a llama. We want to be inclusive here.

Certification benefits:

Use YOLOSEC÷ behind your e-mail signatures to add extra authority to that decision to deploy upgrades on Friday at 16:45.

Brag that you passed the YOLOSEC÷ exam on your first try!  Applied effort is for chumps!
Gain a 20% discount on admission fees to all DumpsterCon events.
Place the YOLOSEC÷ certification in your social media profiles for when you follow the YSF Guidance of "shitpost and troll"
Enjoy a shot of Malort or some Night Train when hanging out with fellow YOLOSEC÷ professionals
